# Angry Flapping Bird Game
# Made by Edward (2440081614)

This game is primarily targeted for children in age groups from 7 to 12 year olds. It is because children usually have a habit of reciting numbers before they actually understand the concept behind them. Though every child is different, most of them nowadays have been proven to master the ablility to count from 0 to 10 by the time they are five years old. At this point in time they have been repeating them mostly by memory and have yet to understand what they actually mean.

The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them, and this part is where the player gets to recite or test their ability to count numbers starting from 0, as each time the player successfully dodged a pipe, their score in the game will be incremented by 1. The player will realise this and begin to recite numbers as they attempt to control the bird to dodge more pipes. On the other hand, children are expected to have increased memory and reflexes after spending some time playing the game.

The controls in this game are very simple and was made that way so that children will be able to easily understand the concepts of the gameplay. All they need to do is simply clicking the mouse connected to the computer, in order to control the bird icon to fly upwards and release the mouse-click to let the bird icon fly downwards automatically.

The goal in this game is to simply reach a score as high as possible by controlling the movement of the bird to fly pass each pair of pipes that are shown each time the bird icon successfully flew pass the preceding pair. The starting score for players at the beginning of the game is 0, and will be incremented by one for each time the bird icon flies through a pair of pipes.
